# SpagBot [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/psnod85ca34bdvxr?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JackRyder/spagbot)
A discord bot written in C# with the love and help of Discord.NET


## What is SpagBot?
Spagbot is a bot built for discord, that allows a guild to play & queue audio from youtube, as well as play livestreams and videos. There are also some other features that guilds may find useful.

## What's the Python file?

The Python file is my way of making sure I don't need libraries in .NET that work for both .NET Framework and .NET Core, which is good because the library that the main one uses is currently .NET Framework only, and has a few copies that don't replicate and work correctly with my current codebase. The .NET core application now works, although it currently only supports YouTube videos and livestreams at the moment :)

## Can I use your bot in my Discord?

You sure can! When I can get the url required for you to add it to your room :)
